      <description>June 30, I left my school after graduation. I have no permission to re-enter my dorm.
July 3, I started my new life working at Microsoft and living in my rented house with a roommate who was my roommate at school.
 Nothing really changed so far.
 I often go back to school to be with my girlfriend. I can still read books in the library and have lunch in canteen.</description>
