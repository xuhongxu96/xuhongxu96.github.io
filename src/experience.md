## Senior SDE (Sep 2022 -- Mar 2025)

[Seed/Data Speech Team](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/direction/speech)  
[ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), Shanghai, China

*Led the development of the Text-to-Speech engine and contributed to the Doubao AI assistant application.*

<!-- - Led the architectural design and development of the Text-to-Speech
  front-end engine, overseeing its overall system integration.
- Developed a streaming Markdown parser, based on the cmark open-source
  library, capable of real-time, character-wise parsing of Markdown
  generated by large language models. Authored a patent for this work,
  which has been adopted in the Doubao/Cici AI assistant application.
- Designed and implemented a cross-lingual [SSML](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/) framework that lowers
  SSML abstract syntax trees to an intermediate representation,
  facilitating flexible modification of synthesized speech across
  multiple languages.
- Enhanced CI/CD pipelines and testing infrastructure by integrating
  sanitizers and static analyzers into continuous integration workflows.
- Collaborated with research teams to engineer and deploy
  state-of-the-art speech AI models based on large language models. -->
