# CS 452/652: Real-Time Programming (the Train Course)

> Spring 25

I *dropped* this course after I learned that it is really *time-consuming*.

However, before I dropped it, I did some research and found some useful resources,
which I summarized in [MarklinSim All-in-One](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/h445xu/cs652) repo.

In short, follow the readme in the repo to set up:

1. MarklinSim (an emulator for the train kit)
2. QEMU (an emulator for the Raspberry Pi 4B)
3. Example Image (your real-time system).

I believe it will save you a lot of time. Good luck!
