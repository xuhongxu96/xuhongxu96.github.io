# Notes for *Foundations of Databases*

[Foundations of Databases (The Alice Book)](http://webdam.inria.fr/Alice/)

The Alice Book is helpful for understanding the basic notations in database theory.
I recommend to read the first two chapters to get familiar with the notations used in this course.

That said, the book is not required.
In fact, paying real attention to the first several lectures should be sufficient to survive the course, and it turns out to be interesting.
