a query (mapping) is _from_ (or _over_) its input schema and _to_ its output schema.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

- _query_: a syntactic object
- _query mapping_: a function defined by a query interpreted under a specified semantics
  - its domain: the family of all instances of an input schema
  - its range: the family of instances of an output schema
  - we often blur query and query mapping when the meaning is clear from context
- _input schema_: a specified relation or database schema
- _output schema_: a relation schema or database schema
  - For a relation schema, the relation name may be specified as part of the query syntax or by the context
- \\(q_1 \equiv q_2\\) denotes two queries \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) over \\(\dbschema{R}\\) are _equivalent_,
  i.e., they have the same output schema and \\(q_1(\dbinst{I}) = q_2(\dbinst{I})\\) for each instance \\(\dbinst{I}\\) over \\(\dbschema{R}\\).

## Logic-Based Perspective

Three versions of conjunctive queries:

1. Rule-Based Conjunctive Queries
1. Tableau Queries
1. Conjunctive Calculus

### Rule-Based Conjunctive Queries

#### Definition

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

A _rule-based conjunctive query_ (or often more simply called _rules_) \\(q\\) over a relation schema \\(\dbschema{R}\\) is an expression of the form
\\[
\ans(u) \leftarrow \rel{R}_1(u_1), \ldots, \rel{R}_n(u_n)
\\]
where \\(n \geq 0\\), \\(\rel{R}_1, \ldots, \rel{R}_n\\) are relation names in \\(\dbschema{R}\\);
\\(\ans\\) is a relation name not in \\(\dbschema{R}\\);
and \\(u, u_1, \ldots, u_n\\) are free tuples (i.e., may use either variables or constants).

- \\(\var(q)\\): the set of variables occurring in \\(q\\).
- _body_: \\(\rel{R}_1(u_1), \ldots, \rel{R}_n(u_n)\\)
- _head_: \\(\ans(u)\\)
- _range restricted_: each variable occurring in the head also occurs in the body
  - all conjunctive queries considered here are range restricted
- _valuation_: a valuation \\(v\\) over \\(V\\), a finite subset of \\(\varSet\\), is a total function \\(v\\) from \\(V\\) to \\(\dom\\) (of constants)
    - extended to be identity on \\(\dom\\) (so that the domain can contain both variables and constants)
    - extended to map free tuples to tuples (so that the domain/range can be in the tuple form)

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Semantics

Let \\(q\\) be the query, and let \\(\dbinst{I}\\) be a database instance of schema \\(\dbschema{R}\\).
The _image_ of \\(\dbinst{I}\\) under \\(q\\) is:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

\\[
q(\dbinst{I}) = \\{ v(u) \mid v \text{ is a valuation over } \var(q) \text{ and } v(u_i) \in \dbinst{I}(\rel{R}_i) \text{ for each } i \in [1, n] \\}
\\]


- _active domain_ 
  - of a database instance \\(\dbinst{I}\\), denoted \\(\adom(\dbinst{I})\\), is the set of constants that occur in \\(\dbinst{I}\\)
  - of a relation instance \\(I\\), denoted \\(\adom(I)\\), is the set of constants that occur in \\(I\\)
  - of a query \\(q\\), denoted \\(\adom(q)\\), is the set of constants that occur in \\(q\\)
  - \\(\adom(q, \dbinst{I})\\) is an abbreviation for \\(\adom(q) \cup \adom(\dbinst{I})\\)
    - \\(\adom(q(\dbinst{I})) \subseteq \adom(q, \dbinst{I})\\)
- _extensional_ relations: relations in the body of the query, i.e., \\(\rel{R}_1, \ldots, \rel{R}_n\\)
  - because they are known/provided by the input instance \\(\dbinst{I}\\)
- _intensional_ relation: the relation in the head of the query, i.e., \\(\ans\\)
  - because it is not stored and its value is computed on request by the query
- _extensional database (edb)_: a database instance associated with the extensional relations
- _intensional database (idb)_: the rule itself
- _idb relation_: the relation defined by the idb

#### Properties

Conjunctive queries are:

- _monotonic_: a query \\(q\\) over \\(\dbschema{R}\\) is monotonic if for each \\{\dbinst{I}, \dbinst{J}\\} over \\(\dbschema{R}\\),
  \\(\dbinst{I} \subseteq \dbinst{J} \implies q(\dbinst{I}) \subseteq q(\dbinst{J})\\)
- _satisfiable_: a query \\(q\\) is satisfiable if there exists a database instance \\(\dbinst{I}\\) such that \\(q(\dbinst{I}) \neq \emptyset\\)

### Tableau Queries

A _tableau query_ is simply a pair \\((\tableau, u)\\) where \\(\tableau\\) is a tableau
and each variable in \\(u\\) also occurs in \\(\tableau\\).

This is closest to the visual form provided by Query-By-Example (QBE).

- _summary_: the free tuple \\(u\\) representing the tuples included in the answer to the query
- _embedding_: a valuation \\(v\\) for the variables occurring in \\(\tableau\\) such that \\(v(\tableau) \subseteq \dbinst{I}\\)
  - the output of \\((\tableau, u)\\) on \\(\dbinst{I}\\) consists of all tuples \\(v(u)\\) for each embedding \\(v\\) of \\(\tableau\\) into \\(\dbinst{I}\\)
- _typed_: a tableau query \\(q = (\tableau, u)\\) under the named perspective, where \\(\tableau\\) is
  over relation schema \\(R\\) and \\(\sort(u) \subseteq \sort(R)\\), is typed if no variable of \\(\tableau\\)
  is associated with two distinct attributes in \\(q\\)

#### Examples

Table _Movies_

| Title         | Director  | Actor         |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| \\(x\_{ti}\\) | "Bergman" | \\(x\_{ac}\\) |

Table _Location_

| Theater       | Address       | Phone     |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| \\(x\_{th}\\) | \\(x\_{ad}\\) | \\(x_p\\) |

Table _Pariscope_

| Theater       | Title         | Schedule     |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| \\(x\_{th}\\) | \\(x\_{ti}\\) | \\(x\_{s}\\) |

The above tableau query is typed because each variable is associated with only one attribute:

- \\(x\_{ti}\\): \\(\attname{Title}\\)
- \\(x\_{ac}\\): \\(\attname{Actor}\\)
- \\(x\_{th}\\): \\(\attname{Theater}\\)
- \\(x\_{ad}\\): \\(\attname{Address}\\)
- \\(x_p\\): \\(\attname{Phone}\\)
- \\(x\_{s}\\): \\(\attname{Schedule}\\)

However, the following tableau query is untyped:

Table _Movies_

| Title         | Director      | Actor         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| \\(x\_{ti}\\) | \\(x\_{ac}\\) | \\(x\_{ac}\\) |

Because \\(x\_{ac}\\) is associated with both \\(\attname{Director}\\) and \\(\attname{Actor}\\).

### Conjunctive Calculus

The conjunctive query
\\[
\ans(u) \leftarrow \rel{R}_1(u_1), \ldots, \rel{R}_n(u_n)
\\]

can be expressed as the following conjunctive calculus query that has the same semantics:
\\[
\left\\{ e_1, \ldots, e_m \vert \exists x_1, \ldots, x_k \left( \rel{R}(u_1) \wedge \ldots \wedge \rel{R}(u_n) \right) \right\\}
\\]
where \\(x_1, \ldots, x_k\\) are all the variables occurring in the body and not the head.

#### Conjunctive Calculus Formula

Let \\(\dbschema{R}\\) be a relation schema.
A _(well-formed) formula_ over \\(\dbschema{R}\\) for the conjunctive calculus is an expression having **one of** the following forms:

1. an atom over \\(\dbschema{R}\\);
2. \\(\varphi \wedge \psi \\), where \\(\varphi\\) and \\(\psi\\) are formulas over \\(\dbschema{R}\\); or
3. \\(\exists x \varphi\\), where \\(x\\) is a variable and \\(\varphi\\) is a formula over \\(\dbschema{R}\\).

An occurrence of a variable \\(x\\) in formula \\(\varphi\\) is _free_ if:

1. \\(\varphi\\) is an atom; or
2. \\(\varphi = (\psi \wedge \xi)\\) and the occurrence of \\(x\\) is free in \\(\psi\\) or \\(\xi\\); or
3. \\(\varphi = \exists y \psi\\), \\(x \neq y\\), and the occurrence of \\(x\\) is free in \\(\psi\\).

\\(\free(\varphi)\\): the set of free variables in \\(\varphi\\).

An occurrence of a variable that is not free is _bound_.

#### Conjunctive Calculus Query

A _conjunctive calculus query_ over database schema \\(\dbschema{R}\\) is an expression of the form
\\[
\\{ e_1, \ldots, e_m \mid \varphi \\}
\\]
where

- \\(\varphi\\) is a conjunctive calculus formula,
- \\(\langle e_1, \ldots, e_m \rangle\\) is a free tuple, and
- the set of variables occurring in \\(\langle e_1, \ldots, e_m \rangle\\) is exactly \\(\free(\varphi)\\).

For named perspective, the above query can be written as:
\\[
\\{ \langle e_1, \ldots, e_m \rangle : A_1, \ldots, A_m \mid \varphi \\}
\\]

> Note: In the previous chapter, a named tuple was usually denoted as:
>
> \\[ \langle A_1:a_1, \ldots, A_m:a_m \rangle \\]
>
> But here we denote the named tuple as:
>
> \\[ \langle e_1, \ldots, e_m \rangle : A_1, \ldots, A_m \\]
>
> Not sure which one is better or whether the author did this intentionally.

#### Semantics

##### Valuation

A _valuation_ over \\(V \subset \varSet \\) is a total function \\(v\\) from \\(V\\) to \\(\dom\\),
which can be viewed as a syntactic expression of the form:
\\[
\\{ x_1/a_1, \ldots, x_n/a_n \\}
\\]
where

- \\(x_1, \ldots, x_n\\) is a listing of \\(V\\),
- \\(a_i = v(x_i)\\) for each \\(i \in [1, n]\\).

##### Interpretation as a Set

If \\(x \not \in V\\), and \\(c \in \dom\\),
then \\(v \cup \\{ x/c \\}\\) is the valuation over \\(V \cup \\{ x \\}\\)
that agrees with \\(v\\) on \\(V\\) and maps \\(x\\) to \\(c\\).

##### Satisfaction

Let \\(\dbschema{R}\\) be a database schema, \\(\varphi\\) a conjunctive calculus formula over \\(\dbschema{R}\\),
and \\(v\\) a valuation over \\(\free(\varphi)\\).
Then \\(\dbinst{I} \models \varphi[v]\\), if

1. \\(\varphi = \rel{R}(u)\\) is an atom and \\(v(u) \in \dbinst{I}(\rel{R})\\); or
2. \\(\varphi = (\psi \wedge \xi)\\) and \\(\dbinst{I} \models \psi[v \vert_{\free(\psi)}]\\) and \\(\dbinst{I} \models \xi[v \vert_{\free(\xi)}]\\); or
3. \\(\varphi = \exists x \psi\\) and there exists a constant \\(c \in \dom\\) such that
   \\(\dbinst{I} \models \psi[v \cup \\{ x/c \\}]\\).

##### Image

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

Let \\(q = \\{ e_1, \ldots, e_m \mid \varphi \\}\\) be a conjunctive calculus query over \\(\dbschema{R}\\).
For an instance \\(\dbinst{I}\\) over \\(\dbschema{R}\\), the _image_ of \\(\dbinst{I}\\) under \\(q\\) is:
\\[
q(\dbinst{I}) = \\{ v( \langle e_1, \ldots, e_m \rangle ) \mid v \text{ is a valuation over } \free(\varphi) \text{ and } \dbinst{I} \models \varphi[v] \\}
\\]

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- _active domain_
  - of a formula \\(\varphi\\), denoted \\(\adom(\varphi)\\), is the set of constants that occur in \\(\varphi\\)
  - \\(\adom(\varphi, \dbinst{I})\\) is an abbreviation for \\(\adom(\varphi) \cup \adom(\dbinst{I})\\)
  - If \\(\dbinst{I} \models \varphi[v]\\), then the range of \\(v\\) is contained in \\(\adom(\dbinst{I})\\)
    - to evaluate a conjunctive calculus query, one need only consider valuations with range constrained in \\(\adom(\varphi, \dbinst{I})\\),
      i.e., only a finite number of them
- _equivalent_: conjunctive calculus formulas \\(\varphi\\) and \\(\psi\\) over \\(\dbschema{R}\\) are equivalent,
  if 
    - they have the same free variables and, 
    - for each \\(\dbinst{I}\\) over \\(\dbschema{R}\\) and valuation \\(v\\) over \\(\free(\varphi) = \free(\psi)\\),
      \\(\dbinst{I} \models \varphi[v]\\) if and only if \\(\dbinst{I} \models \psi[v]\\)
