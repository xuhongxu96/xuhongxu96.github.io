# My Notes

My course on database theory, specifically regarding **Query Processing algorithms**, is coming to an end soon. It has been very rewarding, so I’m writing this down to record what I’ve learned.

I originally chose this course as a challenge because I couldn't understand a single paper mentioned in the syllabus—I didn't even know what problems they were trying to solve. After a semester of struggling to grasp just the surface, I discovered that this is actually quite an interesting—albeit still very difficult—field.

I am writing this note to document the relatively simple and fundamental parts. I also want to organize the logical thread—what is the problem, how is it solved, what new problems arise from that solution, and how are those solved? I hope this will help me pick it up quickly if I need it in the future, and also serve as a simple introduction for readers.
